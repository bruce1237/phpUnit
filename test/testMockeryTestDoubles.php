/**
 * Mockery's main goal is to help us create test doubles, it can create stubs, mocks and spies.
 * 
 * stubs and mocks are created the same. the difference between the two is that a stub only returns
 * a preset result when called, while a mock needs to have expectations set on hte method calls
 * it expects to receive.
 * 
 * Spies are a type of test doubles that keep track of the calls they received, 
 * and allow us to inspect these calls after the face
 * 
 * when creating a test double object, wd can pass in an identifier as a name for our test double.
 * if we pass it no identifier, the test double name will be unknown, Furthermore, the identifier does
 * not have to be a class name. it is a good practice, and our recommendation, to always name the test doubles
 * with the same name as the underlying class we are creating test doubles for.
 * 
 * if the identifier we use for our test double is a name of an existing class, the test double will 
 * inherit the type of the class(via inheritance), i.e. the mock object will pass type hints or instance of
 * evaluations for the existing class. this is useful when a test double must be of a specific type, 
 * to satisfy the expectations our code has.

 */

 * the recommended way to create a stub or a mock object is by using a name of an existing class

 */

$mock = \Mockery::mock('MyClass');

/**
 * this stub or mock object will have the type of MyClass, through inheritance.

 * Mockery also supports creating stub or mock objects based on a single existing class, which must 
 * implement one or more interfaces. we can do this by providing a comma-separated list of the class
 * and interfaces as teh first argument to the \Mockery::mock() method
 * this stub or mock object will now be of type MyClass and implements MyInterface and OtherInterface interfaces

/**

 * 
 * a spy will return `null` for all method calls it receives. it is not possible to tell a spy what will be the

 * 
 * The \Mockery::spy() method call is actually a shorthand for calling 
 * \Mockery::mock()->shoudIgnoreMissing().  the shouldIgnoreMissing method

 */

//  Mocks VS Spies

// let's try and illustrate the difference between mocks and spies with the following example

 * and we get the return result we expect it to return. with a spy object on the other hand,
 * we verify the call has happened after th4e fact(call). the return result of a method call against a spy is 
 * always null
 */


//  Partial Test Doubles

/**
 * partial doubles are useful when we want ot stub out, set expectations for or spy on some methods
 * of a class, but run the actual code for  other methods
 * 
 * we differentiate between three types of partial test doubles:
 * - runtime partial test doubles,
 * - generated partial test doubles 
 * - proxied partial test doubles
 */

//  Runtime partial test doubles
/**
 * what we call a runtime partial, involves creating a test double and then telling it to make 
 * itself partial. any method calls that the double hasn't been toald to allow or expect, will act 
 * as they would on a normal instance of the object
 */

// we can then tell the test double to allow or expect calls as with any other Mockery double

$foo->shouldReceive('foo')->andReturn(456);
$foo->bar(); //int(456);

// generated Partial test doubles
/**
 * the second type of partial double we can create is what we call a generated partial.
 * with generated partials, we specifically tell Mockery which methods we want to be able to allow
 * or expect calls to. all other methods will run the actual code directly, so stubs and expectations on these
 * methods will not work.
 */

class Foo
{
function foo()
{
return 123;

return $this->foo();
}
}

$foo = mock("Foo[foo]");

$foo->foo(); //error, no expectation set

// setting an expectation for this has no effect, as it not been mocked
$foo->shouldReceive('bar')->andReturn(999);

$foo->bar(); //error, no expectation set

/**
 * even though we support generated partial test doubles, we do not recommend using them
 * 
 * one of the reasons why is because a generated partial will call the original constructor of the
 * mocked class. this can have unwanted side-effects during testing application code.
 */



//  Proxied partial test doubles
/**
 * we may encounter a class wihich is simply not capable of being mocked bacause it has been marked as final. 
 * simiarly, we may find a class with methods marked as final. in such a scenario, we cannot simply extends
 * the class and override method to mock.  so we create the following
 */

$mock = \Mockery::mock(new MyClass);

/**
 * yes, the new mock is a proxy. it intercepts calls and reroutes them to the proxied object
 * which we construct and pass in for methods which are not subject to any expectations. 
 * indirectly, this allows us to mock methods marked final since the proxy is not subject ot those limitations.
 * the tradeoff should be obvious- a proxied partial will fail any typehint checks for the class being mocked since it can not extend the class
 */

//   Aliasing
/**
 * prefixing the valid name of a class (which is NOT currently loaded) with `alias:`
 * will generate an 'alias mock', alias mocks create a class alias with the given classname to stdClass and are
 * generally used to enable the mocking of public static methods. expectations set on the new mock object which 
 * refer to static methods will be used by all static calls to this class
 * 
 * this is NOT recommended
 */

$mock = \Mockery::mock('alias:MyClass');

//  Overloading
/**
 * prefixing the valid name of a class (which is not currently loaded) with `overload:` will generate
 * a alias mock except that created new instances of the class will import any expectations set on the origin mock($mock)
 * the origin mock is never verified since it's used oan expectation store for new instances
 * for this purpose we use term 'instance mock' to differentiate it from the simple 'alias mock'
 * 
 * in other words, an instance mock will intercept when a new instance of the mocked class is created
 * then the mock will be used instead. this is useful especially when mocking hard dependencies.
 */
$mock = \Mockery::mock('overload:MyClass');
/**
 * using alias/instance mocks across more than one test will generate a fatal error since we can 't have two classes of the same name
 * to avoid this, run each test of this kind in a separate PHP process
 */


//  Named Mocks
/**
 * the namedMock() method will generate a class called by the first argument, so in this example 
 * MyCalssName. the rest of the arguments are treated in the same way as the mock method
 */
$mock = \Mockery::namedMock('MyClassName', 'DateTime');

/**
 * this example would create a class called MyClassName that extends DateTime
 * 
 * named mocks are quite an edge case, but they can be useful when code depends on 
 * the __CLASSS__ magic constant, or when we need two dervatives of an abstract type, 
 * that are actually different classes
 * 
 * we can only create a named mock once, any subsequent calls to namedMock with different
 * arguments are likely to cause exceptions
 */

//  Constructor arguments
/**
 * sometimes the mocked class has required constructor arguments. we can pass these to Mockery

 */
$mock = \Mockery::mock('MyClass', 'MyInterface', [$constructorArg1, $constructorArg2]);

/**
 * Mockery now know to pass in $constructorArg1 and $constructorArg2 as arguments to the constructor.

//  Behavior Modifiers

/**
 * this form of mock object will defer all methods not subject to an expectation to the parent class
 * of the mock. i.e. MyClass, whereas the previous shouldIgnoreMissing() returned null, this behaviour simply calls the parent's matching method.

//  Expectation Declarations
/**
 * in order for our expectations to work we must call Mockery::close(), preferably in a callback
 * method such as tearDown or _after(depending on whether or not we're integrating mockery with another framework)
 * this static call cleans up the mockery container used by the current test, and run any verification tasks needed for our expectations.
 *

 * and how it should be called. this is where the mockery expectation declarations take over.
